        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
        <p>When someone puts all their money into one risky financial asset, they may get lucky and make a lot of money.
            But that doesn’t make it a good decision.
            Decision quality is independent of outcome quality.

            Self-serving bias makes us think that if the outcome is good, then it was our abilities that caused it, and
            we did well. When the outcome is unfavourable, we often blame it on bad luck or external factors.</p>
        <p>Our Defaults — Human Nature
            I'm incapable of making important decisions early in the morning. I need at least an hour for my brain to
            process information properly.

            Our biology plays a huge role in our ability to make good judgments. Knowing when you are at your best is
            valuable information to use.

            We are affected by hunger, thirst, sleep deprivation and other basic needs of our bodies.

            Being aware of these factors can help us reduce their influence.

            Emotional: We respond to the emotions of others. We feel attacked when someone gives us negative feedback.
            It helps to wait until emotions calm down before reacting.

            Ego: We have a strong desire to feel right, not necessarily be right. Each time someone rejects our proposed
            solution, we feel attacked, even if their solution is objectively better. It’s good to detach what we do
            from who we are.

            Social: We lean towards conformity, we want to be liked, when someone omits us from the invitation to the
            meeting, then we get scared and assume bad intentions. It’s important to know our self-worth and not pay
            that much attention to what others think about us.

            Inertia: We seek stability and avoid changes. Avoiding conflicts is easier than having a difficult
            conversation. Breaking inertia requires effort, and we tend to choose the easier option.

            It’s impossible to turn our reactions off, but being aware of these defaults helps with understanding how we
            behave.</p>
